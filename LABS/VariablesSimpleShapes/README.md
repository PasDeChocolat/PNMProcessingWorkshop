# LAB: Variables - Simple Shapes

### Overview

This lab is designed to show you how to draw simple shapes with color and variables. First, you'll draw some simple shapes. Then, you'll change the colors. We'll add later add variables to the mix to make things easier.

### Instructions

#### Draw some shapes

1. Open the sketch by double clicking the VariablesSimpleShapes.pde file.
2. Run the sketch by pressing the *Run* button. It looks like a *Play* â–¶ button.
3. You should see three shapes (our tribute to Kazimir Malevich). Like this: ![Three Shapes](https://raw.github.com/PasDeChocolat/PNMProcessingWorkshop_Summer2013/master/LABS/VariablesSimpleShapes/three_shapes.png)

#### Add some color

1. Change the sketch so that the *plus* and *circle* are filled with red, and the *square* is filled with green.
2. Do this by adding a call to `fill()` before you draw each shape.
3. You should see this: ![Colored Shapes](https://raw.github.com/PasDeChocolat/PNMProcessingWorkshop_Summer2013/master/LABS/VariablesSimpleShapes/colored_shapes.png)
4. If you get stuck, check out [the solution](https://github.com/PasDeChocolat/PNMProcessingWorkshop_Summer2013/tree/master/LABS/SOLUTIONS/VariablesSimpleShapesWithColor/VariablesSimpleShapesWithColor.pde).
