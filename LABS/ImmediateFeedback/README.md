# LAB: Immediate Feedback

### Overview

Take a look at this Processing sketch. Don't worry if you don't understand everything that's going on here.

### Instructions

1. Open the sketch by double clicking the ImmediateFeedback.pde file.
2. Run the sketch by pressing the *Run* button. It looks like a *Play* â–¶ button.
3. You should see a red rectangle.
4. Look at the first four lines of this sketch.
5. Try to guess what these four lines do.
6. Line 1 is a comment line (it starts with `//`), Processing ignores it.
7. In line 2 `size` is used to specify the *size* of the display window.
8. In line 3 `fill` is used to select the color to draw with. Colors are specified by their red, green, and blue values (RGB). The values can go from 0 to 255 (0 is lowest, 255 highest).
9. In line 4 `rect` is used to draw a rectangle. Rectangles are specified as the x & y coordinates of the top left corner, their width & height.
10. The last two lines are commented out, so they don't do anything.
11. Uncomment the last two lines by removing the `//` at the beginning of each line.
12. In order to see your changes in the display window you have to restart the sketch. Stop the sketch by pressing the *Stop* button.
13. Restart the sketch by pressing the *Run* button again.
14. Notice the changes and try to guess why the occurred.

### Extra Credit

#### Opening a Sketch

There are a lot of different ways to open a sketch. To make things easier for you, try opening a sketch in different ways:

* Close the sketch. Then, try opening the sketch by dragging it to the dock (if you haven't already).
* Close the sketch. Then, try opening the sketch by going to the top menu's `File > Open...`
* Close the sketch. Then, try opening the sketch by going to `File > Recent > ...ImmediateFeedback`

#### Experiments with Color

The `fill` commands specify what color will be used to draw the rectangle and ellipse. The `fill` color is specified by it's RGB color combination. RGB stands for red, green, & blue. The values for each color component range from 0 to 255. 0 means none at all. 255 means as much as possible.

* Try changeing the RBG values in this sketch's `fill` functions.
